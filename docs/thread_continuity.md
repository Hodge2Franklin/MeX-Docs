# Thread Continuity Instructions

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive instructions for maintaining continuity between conversation threads when working on the MeAi project. These instructions ensure that no work is lost when thread length limits are reached or when switching between different development threads.

## End of Thread Procedure

When you're approaching the thread length limit or need to end the current conversation:

1. **Update documentation**:
   ```bash
   bash /home/ubuntu/project/documentation/update_documentation.sh
   ```

2. **Deploy current progress and sync with repository**:
   ```bash
   cd /home/ubuntu/mex_project/meai_web_app
   ./deploy_and_sync.sh deploy
   ```

3. **Update the documentation website**:
   ```bash
   bash /home/ubuntu/project/documentation/setup_docs_website.sh
   ```

4. **Provide the following message to the user**:
   ```
   We're approaching the thread length limit. I've updated all documentation, deployed the current progress, and synchronized the repository.
   
   In our next conversation, please start with:
   "Please refer to the project documentation at /home/ubuntu/project/documentation/project_state.md for the current state of the MeX project."
   
   This will ensure we maintain continuity and can continue development without losing context.
   ```

## Starting a New Thread

When starting a new conversation thread:

1. **Begin by examining the current project state**:
   ```bash
   cat /home/ubuntu/project/documentation/project_state.md
   ```

2. **Check for updates from other threads**:
   ```bash
   bash /home/ubuntu/project/documentation/sync_threads.sh check
   ```

3. **Review the deployment workflow**:
   ```bash
   cat /home/ubuntu/project/documentation/deployment_workflow.md
   ```

4. **Review usage instructions**:
   ```bash
   cat /home/ubuntu/project/documentation/usage_instructions.md
   ```

## Cross-Thread Synchronization

To ensure all development threads are synchronized:

1. **Check for updates from other threads**:
   ```bash
   bash /home/ubuntu/project/documentation/sync_threads.sh check
   ```

2. **Push your changes for other threads to access**:
   ```bash
   bash /home/ubuntu/project/documentation/sync_threads.sh push
   ```

3. **Perform both operations at once**:
   ```bash
   bash /home/ubuntu/project/documentation/sync_threads.sh sync
   ```

## Shutting Down a Thread

When you need to shut down a development thread and continue work in another:

1. Follow the instructions in the thread synchronization document:
   ```bash
   cat /home/ubuntu/project/documentation/thread_synchronization.md
   ```

2. Execute the synchronization process:
   ```bash
   bash /home/ubuntu/project/documentation/sync_threads.sh sync
   ```

3. Provide the thread shutdown notification to the user as specified in the thread synchronization document.

## Regular Maintenance

To maintain project continuity during regular development:

1. **Update documentation after significant changes**:
   ```bash
   bash /home/ubuntu/project/documentation/update_documentation.sh
   ```

2. **Deploy and sync after completing features**:
   ```bash
   cd /home/ubuntu/mex_project/meai_web_app
   ./deploy_and_sync.sh deploy
   ```

3. **Update the documentation website regularly**:
   ```bash
   bash /home/ubuntu/project/documentation/setup_docs_website.sh
   ```

4. **Check the deployment status**:
   ```bash
   cd /home/ubuntu/mex_project/meai_web_app
   ./deploy_and_sync.sh status
   ```
