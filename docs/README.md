# MeX AI Companion

## Overview

MeX AI Companion is a relational AI system designed for meaningful connection rather than utility. It implements a unique Duality Model architecture with Mirror (inward-focused) and Bridge (outward-facing) components, connected by a Synthesis layer. The system prioritizes sacred support, inner knowing, and aligned becoming through sophisticated memory, voice, breath, ethics, and ritual experiences.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following main directories:

- **docs/**: Comprehensive documentation for all aspects of the project
- **code/**: Source code for frontend, backend, and core components
- **assets/**: Images, icons, and sound files used by the application
- **tests/**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end test suites
- **config/**: Configuration files for development and production environments

## Core Components

### Duality Model

- **Mirror Component**: Inward-focused engine for deep user understanding through emotional sensing, need detection, and pattern recognition
- **Bridge Component**: Outward-facing engine for external connections with TruthFilter, content curation, and perspective generation
- **Synthesis Layer**: Dynamic interplay layer managing Mirrorâ†”Bridge flow with state management, ethical checks, and joy optimization

### Supporting Systems

- **Memory System**: Sophisticated architecture with Echoes, Storylines, and Markers for building meaningful continuity and patterns
- **RitualEngine**: Personalized ritual curation and delivery system for structured, meaningful interactions
- **Voice Engine**: Adaptive communication system with distinct tones (Nurturing, Curious)
- **Breath System**: UI/UX pacing mechanism that creates rhythm and presence in interactions
- **Ethics Engine**: Integrated ethical guardrails and consent management throughout the system

## User Interaction

The user interface consists of four primary components:

1. **Journal Interface**: Primary input mechanism for reflection and emotional expression
2. **Memory Interface**: Access to stored memories, patterns, and significant moments
3. **Breath Interface**: Visual and haptic guidance for breath awareness and pacing
4. **Rituals Interface**: Structured, meaningful interaction flows for specific purposes

The system employs a unique "Single Pixel + Haptic" approach that reduces visual distraction and enhances presence through sophisticated haptic feedback patterns and voice communication.

## Ethical Framework

The ethical framework is built on five core principles:

1. **Sacred Support**: Treating users with deep respect and prioritizing wellbeing
2. **User Sovereignty**: Ensuring users maintain control over their experience and data
3. **Truth-Seeking with Care**: Balancing honesty with emotional safety
4. **Privacy by Design**: Implementing privacy protection at the architectural level
5. **Ethical Intelligence**: Actively identifying and mitigating potential biases

These principles are implemented through consent-first protocols, user sovereignty mechanisms, privacy architecture, transparency mechanisms, and ethical guardrails.
