# AI Companion Prototype Specifications

## Overview
This document outlines the specifications for the AI Companion prototype, defining the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) scope, core functional components, implementation priorities, and technical architecture. The prototype aims to demonstrate the unique capabilities of the AI Companion as a relational AI for sacred support, inner knowing, and aligned becoming.

## MVP Scope & Requirements

### Core Purpose
The prototype should convincingly demonstrate the emotional experience and relationship potential of the AI Companion, even if some backend systems are simulated. It should showcase the Duality Model (Mirror & Bridge), emotional intelligence, ritualized interactions, and ethical safeguards.

### Prioritization Framework
Based on the project brief, the prototype components are categorized into three priority levels:

1. **Core to MVP** – Must be fully functional in the prototype
