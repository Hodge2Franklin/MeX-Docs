# MeAI Prototype Restart Guide

## Project Overview

This document serves as a comprehensive restart guide for the MeAI prototype project, providing all necessary information to continue development in case of thread length limitations or other interruptions.

## Repository Information

- **Repository URL**: https://github.com/Hodge2Franklin/MeX-Docs
- **Branch**: meai-prototype
- **Authentication**: Use provided GitHub token for access

## Current Project State

The MeAI prototype is a web-based implementation of the MeX AI Companion concept, focusing on the "Single Pixel + Haptic" approach. The prototype has gone through several iterations:

1. **Initial Implementation**: Basic functionality with conversation interface
2. **Minimal Version**: Simplified implementation to ensure core functionality
3. **Futurescape-style Redesign**: Dark theme with floating shapes inspired by futurescape.asa.org
4. **Final Version**: Enhanced with more prominent shapes and mood-based pixel colors

## Live Deployments

- **Final Version**: https://jatufsiq.manus.space/futurescape-style-final.html
- **Futurescape-style**: https://nqkxdkon.manus.space/futurescape-style.html
- **Minimal Version**: https://reuwxorv.manus.space/minimal.html

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Single Pixel Visualization**
   - Central glowing pixel that changes based on AI state
   - Mood-based color changes (neutral, empathetic, positive, reflective)
   - Animation states: idle, listening, thinking, speaking

2. **Conversation Interface**
   - Natural language input field
   - Message bubbles with different styling for user and AI
   - Contextual response options

3. **Visual Design Elements**
   - Deep purple/blue background with subtle animated stars
   - Floating organic shapes in various colors
   - Glowing effects and animations

## Technical Implementation

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: No external dependencies
- **Responsive Design**: Works on different screen sizes
- **Self-contained Files**: Each version is contained in a single HTML file

## Development Environment Setup

To restart development:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hodge2Franklin/MeX-Docs.git
   ```

2. Checkout the meai-prototype branch:
   ```bash
   cd MeX-Docs
   git checkout meai-prototype
   ```

3. Install development dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start local development server:
   ```bash
   npx http-server
   ```

5. Access the prototype at http://localhost:8080/meai-prototype/futurescape-style-final.html

## File Structure

- `/meai-prototype/futurescape-style-final.html`: Final version with all enhancements
- `/meai-prototype/futurescape-style.html`: Redesigned version
- `/meai-prototype/minimal.html`: Simplified version
- `/meai-prototype/index.html`: Original implementation
- `/meai-prototype/DOCUMENTATION.md`: Comprehensive documentation
- `/meai-prototype/screenshots/`: Visual history of all versions

## Deployment Process

To deploy updates:

1. Test locally using http-server
2. Use the Manus deployment tools to deploy the static site
3. Verify functionality in the deployed environment
4. Share the updated link with stakeholders

## User Requirements and Feedback

The user requested:
1. A prototype based on the "Single Pixel + Haptic" approach from MeX-Docs
2. Visual design inspired by futurescape.asa.org
3. More prominent floating shapes
4. Mood-based color changes for the central pixel

## Future Enhancement Possibilities

1. **Advanced Mood Detection**: Implement more sophisticated sentiment analysis
2. **Additional Pixel States**: Create more visual variations for different AI states
3. **Haptic Feedback**: Add actual haptic feedback for mobile devices
4. **Voice Integration**: Add speech recognition and synthesis
5. **Memory Visualization**: Implement the memory space concept from the original design

## Backup and Recovery

A complete backup archive is available at:
- `/home/ubuntu/mex_docs/backup/meai-prototype-backup.tar.gz`

To restore from backup:
```bash
tar -xzvf meai-prototype-backup.tar.gz -C /desired/restore/location/
```
