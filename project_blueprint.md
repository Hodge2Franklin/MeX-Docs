#### Mirror Component
The Mirror serves as an inward-focused engine for deep user understanding, incorporating:
- **Emotional Sensing**: Detection and analysis of emotional states
- **Need Detection**: Mapping emotions to underlying needs
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identification of recurring themes and behaviors
- **Value Alignment**: Understanding user's core values and priorities
- **Reflection Generation**: Creating meaningful insights and perspectives

The Mirror Component is grounded in the Transactive Systems Model of Collective Intelligence (TSM-CI), adapted for the dyadic human-AI relationship, and implemented through an Instance-Based Learning Theory (IBLT) approach to Machine Theory of Human Mind (MToHM). It implements a three-tiered needs framework integrating Self-Determination Theory (SDT), contextual expressions, and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) principles, with cultural adaptation and embedded ethical constraints.

#### Bridge Component
The Bridge functions as an outward-facing engine for external connections, featuring:
- **MCPClientInterface**: Discovery backbone for external resources
- **TruthFilter**: Ensuring honest, relevant external signals
- **Content Curator**: Organizing external content into meaningful collections
- **Perspective Generator**: Creating alternative viewpoints
- **Framing Engine**: Contextualizing content for personal relevance
- **Opportunity Scout**: Identifying serendipitous connections aligned with needs and values

The Bridge Component extends the Transactive Systems Model to the interaction between the user-AI dyad and the external information ecosystem, transforming the rich internal understanding of the user into meaningful connections with the external world.

#### Synthesis Layer
The Synthesis layer manages the dynamic interplay between Mirror and Bridge, including:
- **State Manager**: Tracking user emotional state and context
- **Transition Controller**: Managing Mirrorâ†”Bridge transitions
- **Flourishing Engine**: Optimizing for holistic user wellbeing
- **Adaptive Guidance Engine**: Generating contextually appropriate guidance
- **Experience Coordinator**: Creating unified experience across components

The Synthesis Layer serves as the central orchestrating intelligence of the MeAi system, implementing the Transactive Reasoning System (TRS) from the TSM-CI model, adapted for the dyadic human-AI relationship. It maintains the user's complex state, handles transitions between components, optimizes for holistic flourishing, executes adaptive guidance, ensures ethical coherence, and coordinates the unified user experience.
