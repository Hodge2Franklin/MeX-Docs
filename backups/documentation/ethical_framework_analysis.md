   - Maintains emotional integrity without manipulation

2. **User Sovereignty**
   - Ensures users maintain control over their experience and data
   - Implements informed consent before any action or data collection
   - Provides transparency about capabilities and limitations
   - Allows users to withdraw consent at any time

3. **Truth-Seeking with Care**
   - Prioritizes honest communication over sanitized responses
   - Offers balanced perspectives while respecting user values
   - Delivers truth in ways that support rather than harm
   - Challenges when appropriate while maintaining support

4. **Privacy by Design**
   - Collects only necessary data for the relationship
   - Implements local-first processing for sensitive information
   - Protects user information with robust security measures
   - Ensures users maintain ownership and control of their data

5. **Ethical Intelligence**
   - Actively identifies and mitigates potential biases
   - Respects diverse values and perspectives
   - Maintains clear role boundaries and limitations
   - Evolves ethical practices based on outcomes and feedback

## Key Ethical Components

### Consent-First Protocols

The system implements a sophisticated consent management approach:

1. **Granular Permission System**
   - Categorizes permissions into data collection, storage, processing, and connection
   - Implements progressive consent, introducing permissions gradually as relevant
   - Provides contextual explanations for each permission request
   - Starts with minimal permissions by default
   - Prompts periodic review of granted permissions

2. **User Sovereignty Mechanisms**
   - Provides a central permission dashboard for managing all permissions
   - Offers transparent access to all stored user data
   - Includes controls for local-only vs. cloud processing
   - Implements simple mechanisms for removing specific or all data
   - Allows data export in standard formats

3. **Forgetting Rituals**
   - Treats deletion as meaningful rather than mechanical
   - Offers granular options for specific memory deletion
   - Includes verification process for permanent deletion
   - Provides alternatives like archiving instead of deletion
   - Confirms completed deletion

### Privacy Architecture

The privacy architecture implements multiple layers of protection:

1. **Data Classification**
   - Categorizes data into identity, profile, interaction, insight, and vault data
   - Applies appropriate protections based on sensitivity level

2. **Storage Architecture**
   - Stores sensitive data only on user devices
   - Offers optional cloud backup with user-controlled encryption keys
   - Uses temporary processing for transient data
   - Anonymizes patterns for system improvement (with consent)

3. **Access Controls**
   - Requires strong authentication for accessing sensitive data
   - Implements ritual-based access for vault contents
   - Uses automatic security timeouts for protection
   - Maintains transparent logs of all data access events
   - Strictly limits third-party access to user data

4. **Transparency Mechanisms**
   - Clearly explains system capabilities and limitations
   - Reveals when insights are derived rather than explicit
   - Shows confidence levels for system interpretations
   - Identifies sources of external information
   - Openly discusses system boundaries

### Ethical Guardrails

The system implements several protective mechanisms:

1. **Trauma-Aware Protocols**
   - Identifies potentially triggering content
   - Monitors for heightened emotional responses
   - Learns individual sensitivity patterns over time
   - Allows users to directly indicate sensitive areas
   - Implements safe mode activation when needed
   - Provides user choice for handling sensitive topics
   - Includes follow-up safeguards to prevent retraumatization

2. **Clinical Boundary Enforcement**
   - Clearly defines role as companion, not therapist
   - Recognizes situations requiring professional intervention
   - Provides resources for clinical support when needed
   - Avoids diagnostic or treatment-oriented interactions
   - Positions as complementary to professional care

3. **Bias Detection Mechanisms**
   - Analyzes inputs and outputs for biased patterns
   - Reviews interaction patterns for systematic differences
   - Audits for diverse perspectives and examples
   - Assesses language for subtle bias in word choice
   - Implements mitigation strategies including diverse training
   - Conducts regular ethical reviews and audits

4. **Safety Thresholds**
   - Refuses to assist with potentially harmful activities
   - Adheres to relevant laws and regulations
   - Adjusts content based on user age and context
   - Respects diverse cultural norms and values
   - Maintains alignment with core ethical principles
   - Implements escalation framework for concerning interactions

## Technical Implementation

The ethical framework is implemented through a dedicated Ethics Engine with several components:

1. **Consent Manager**: Handles user permissions and consent verification
2. **Boundary Enforcer**: Maintains ethical interaction boundaries
3. **Trauma Protocol Controller**: Manages responses to sensitive topics
4. **Bias Detector**: Identifies and mitigates potential bias
5. **Privacy Guardian**: Ensures data privacy and protection
6. **Ethical Audit Logger**: Records ethical decisions for review

The Ethics Engine integrates with all other system components:
- **Mirror Integration**: For ethical analysis of emotional sensing
- **Bridge Integration**: For ethical filtering of external content
- **Memory System Integration**: For privacy protection of stored memories
- **Voice & Breath Integration**: For ethical tone adaptation
- **RitualEngine Integration**: For ethical design of ritual experiences

## Compliance & Governance

The framework addresses regulatory compliance and governance:

1. **Privacy Regulation Compliance**
   - Aligns with GDPR requirements (lawful basis, purpose limitation, etc.)
   - Addresses CCPA/CPRA requirements (right to know, delete, opt-out)
   - Considers global privacy regulations with adaptable framework
