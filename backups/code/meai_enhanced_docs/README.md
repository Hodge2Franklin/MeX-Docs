# MeAi Documentation Repository

This repository contains the comprehensive documentation for MeAi, a groundbreaking relational AI system designed to deliver sacred support, nurture inner knowing, and enable aligned becoming. The documentation follows a rigorous, first-principles driven approach, using structured use cases to back-engineer the detailed architecture, data models, and component interactions.

## About MeAi

MeAi is a pioneering AI companion that operates on a unique Duality Model, architecturally separating and harmonizing internal reflection (Mirror) and external connection (Bridge), orchestrated by a central Synthesis layer. Unlike conventional AI assistants focused on task efficiency, MeAi builds meaningful relationships with users through emotional attunement, personalized rituals, and ethical design.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into several key sections:

- **Introduction**: Mission, vision, and fundamental principles
- **Architecture**: Solution and cloud architecture diagrams and explanations
- **Components**: Detailed specs for Synthesis, Mirror, Bridge, Memory System, etc.
- **Data Architecture**: Data models, schemas, and pipelines
- **MCP Integration**: Integration with the Model Context Protocol
- **Use Cases**: Detailed walkthroughs of MeAi interactions
- **Glossary**: Definitions of key terms and concepts

## Key Features of This Documentation

- **Use Case Driven**: ~250 detailed use cases drive the architectural design
- **MCP Integration**: Comprehensive implementation of the Model Context Protocol
- **First Principles Thinking**: Every decision is justified from first principles
- **Rigorous Standards**: Consistent formatting, diagramming, and version control
- **Comprehensive Scope**: 100+ pages covering all aspects of MeAi's design

## Core Components

MeAi consists of several integrated components:

- **Synthesis**: The central orchestrator that manages the flow between Mirror and Bridge
- **Mirror**: Facilitates introspection, self-reflection, and emotional analysis
- **Bridge**: Connects users to external resources with TruthFilter verification
- **Memory System**: Stores and retrieves patterns (Echoes) and significant events (Markers)
- **Ritual Engine**: Delivers personalized, meaningful interaction sequences
- **TruthFilter**: Evaluates the veracity and relevance of external information
- **JoyOptimizer**: Optimizes interactions using the J-Index to balance core human needs

## MCP Context Protocol

MeAi implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a framework for structured exchange of context between AI components. The documentation includes detailed schemas for all MCP contexts used in MeAi, including:

- EmotionalStateContext
- ReflectionContext
- MemoryContext
- ResourceContext
- SessionStateContext
