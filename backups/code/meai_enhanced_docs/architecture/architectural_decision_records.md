# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) for MeAi

## Overview

This document contains the Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) for the MeAi system. ADRs capture important architectural decisions made during the development of MeAi, including the context, considered alternatives, chosen approach, and consequences. These records provide transparency into the decision-making process and serve as valuable reference for current and future development teams.

## ADR-001: Duality Model Architecture

### Status
Accepted

### Context
The MeAi system needs an architecture that can both deeply understand users' internal emotional states and connect them with relevant external resources. Traditional AI architectures tend to excel at either internal processing (like emotional analysis) or external connections (like information retrieval), but rarely both simultaneously.

### Decision
We will implement a Duality Model architecture with two primary components:
1. **Mirror Component**: Focused inward on understanding and reflecting the user's emotional state, patterns, and needs
2. **Bridge Component**: Focused outward on connecting users with relevant external resources, information, and guidance
3. **Synthesis Layer**: Orchestrating the interaction between Mirror and Bridge components

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Monolithic Architecture**: A single system handling both emotional understanding and external connections
   - Pros: Simpler implementation, potentially more consistent responses
   - Cons: Lacks specialization, difficult to optimize for different types of processing, harder to scale

2. **Microservices Architecture**: Many small, specialized services for different aspects of functionality
   - Pros: Highly modular, independently scalable, technology flexibility
   - Cons: Complex orchestration, potential performance issues from inter-service communication, harder to maintain coherent user experience

3. **Pipeline Architecture**: Sequential processing of user input through various stages
   - Pros: Clear processing flow, easier to debug, well-established pattern
   - Cons: Less flexible for non-linear interactions, potential bottlenecks, doesn't naturally support the dual nature of internal/external focus

### Rationale
The Duality Model architecture was chosen because:
1. It directly maps to the philosophical foundation of MeAi, which recognizes the importance of both internal reflection and external connection
2. It allows specialized optimization of each component for its specific purpose
3. It enables clear separation of concerns while maintaining a coherent user experience
4. It provides natural points for ethical guardrails and privacy protections
5. It supports the concept of "sacred support" by balancing inward understanding with outward guidance

### Consequences
#### Positive
- Clear separation of concerns between internal understanding and external connections
- Ability to optimize each component independently
- Natural support for the philosophical underpinnings of MeAi
- Flexibility to evolve each component separately

#### Negative
- More complex than a monolithic approach
- Requires careful design of the Synthesis layer to maintain coherent experience
- Potential for increased development effort to implement and maintain two specialized components

### Implementation Notes
- Mirror and Bridge components should have independent processing capabilities but share a common context model
- Synthesis layer needs robust orchestration capabilities to manage the flow between components
- Clear interfaces between components are essential for maintainability
- Monitoring should track performance and effectiveness of each component separately

## ADR-002: Memory System Architecture

### Status
Accepted

### Context
MeAi needs to remember past interactions, recognize patterns, and build a personalized understanding of each user over time. This requires a sophisticated memory system that balances comprehensive storage with efficient retrieval, while maintaining strong privacy protections.
