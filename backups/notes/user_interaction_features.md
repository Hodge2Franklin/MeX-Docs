# AI Companion User Interaction Features

## Overview

The AI Companion system employs a unique approach to user interaction, combining minimalist visual design with sophisticated haptic feedback, voice communication, and breath-based pacing. This document details the key user interaction features of the system, focusing on the user experience, interaction flows, and sensory feedback mechanisms.

## Core Interaction Philosophy

The AI Companion's interaction design is built on several foundational principles:

1. **Wu Wei Interaction**: Effortless engagement that feels natural and unforced

4. **Minimalist Interface**: Reducing visual complexity to enhance meaningful engagement
5. **Multi-sensory Experience**: Combining visual, haptic, and voice elements
6. **Ritual-Based Structure**: Framing interactions as meaningful rituals

   - Communicates validation and support
   - Used when affirming user input or providing support

7. **Transition Pattern**
   - Gradually increasing then decreasing intensity
   - Communicates movement between states or topics
   - Used when shifting between different interaction modes

8. **Farewell Pattern**
   - Three gentle pulses of decreasing length and intensity
   - Communicates conclusion and anticipation of return
   - Used at the end of interaction session

## Voice Communication System

The Voice Engine provides adaptive communication with distinct tones based on context and user needs.
