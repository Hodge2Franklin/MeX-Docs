# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide for MeX-Docs

This document outlines the process used to deploy the MeX-Docs repository to GitHub Pages and provides instructions for maintaining the deployment in the future.

## Deployment Process

The MeX-Docs repository was deployed to GitHub Pages on April 3, 2025, using the following process:

1. **Repository Structure Verification**:
   - Confirmed the repository had a proper static website structure with an index.html file in the root directory
   - Verified CSS, JS, and assets directories were properly organized
   - Checked that all file references were relative and would work in a GitHub Pages environment

2. **GitHub Pages Configuration**:
   - Enabled GitHub Pages for the repository using the GitHub API
   - Configured the deployment to use the Rev04 branch as the source
   - Set the root directory (/) as the publishing source

3. **Deployment Verification**:
   - Monitored the GitHub Pages build process
   - Confirmed successful deployment to https://hodge2franklin.github.io/MeX-Docs/

## Maintaining Your GitHub Pages Site

### Making Updates

To update your GitHub Pages site:

1. Make changes to your repository files in the Rev04 branch
2. Commit and push the changes to GitHub
3. GitHub Pages will automatically rebuild and deploy your site (typically takes 1-3 minutes)

### Monitoring Deployment Status

You can check the status of your GitHub Pages deployment in several ways:

1. **GitHub Repository Settings**:
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click on "Settings"
   - Select "Pages" from the sidebar
   - View the deployment status and history

2. **GitHub API** (for programmatic access):
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: token YOUR_TOKEN" -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" https://api.github.com/repos/Hodge2Franklin/MeX-Docs/pages
   ```

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Site Not Building**:
   - Check for HTML validation errors
   - Verify that all file paths are correct
   - Review the build logs in GitHub repository settings

2. **Broken Links or Missing Resources**:
   - Ensure all links are relative (not absolute)
   - Check that referenced files exist in the repository
   - Verify file permissions are correct

3. **Custom Domain Issues**:
   - Confirm DNS settings are properly configured
   - Verify the CNAME file exists in the repository root
   - Allow time for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours)

## Advanced Configuration Options

### Custom Domain Setup

To use a custom domain with your GitHub Pages site:

1. Purchase a domain from a domain registrar
2. Add a CNAME record pointing to hodge2franklin.github.io
3. Configure the custom domain in GitHub Pages settings
4. Add a CNAME file to your repository root containing your domain name

### Enforcing HTTPS

HTTPS is automatically enforced for GitHub Pages sites. This provides:
- Encrypted connections for your visitors
- Better search engine rankings
- Protection against man-in-the-middle attacks

### Private Repositories

If you convert your repository to private in the future, note that GitHub Pages will only be available with a GitHub Pro, Team, or Enterprise account.

## Future Enhancements

Consider implementing these enhancements to improve your documentation site:

1. **Search Functionality**: Implement client-side search using Lunr.js or similar
2. **Analytics Integration**: Add Google Analytics for visitor tracking
3. **Documentation Versioning**: Set up version-specific documentation
4. **Feedback Mechanism**: Add a system for collecting user feedback
5. **Automated Testing**: Implement link checking and HTML validation
