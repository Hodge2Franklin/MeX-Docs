## üîç Overview

MeX AI Companion is a relational AI system designed for meaningful connection rather than utility. It implements a unique Duality Model architecture with Mirror (inward-focused) and Bridge (outward-facing) components, connected by a Synthesis layer. The system prioritizes sacred support, inner knowing, and aligned becoming through sophisticated memory, voice, breath, ethics, and ritual experiences.

## üìã Repository Structure

  - **implementation/**: Implementation roadmap and plans
  - **user_interaction/**: User interface and experience documentation
  - **guides/**: User and documentation guides
- **code/**: Source code for frontend, backend, and core components
  - **frontend/**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the web interface
  - **backend/**: Server-side code (to be implemented)
  - **core/**: Core system components (to be implemented)
- **assets/**: Images, icons, and sound files used by the application
  - **images/**: Visual assets including diagrams and UI elements
  - **sounds/**: Audio assets (to be implemented)
- **tests/**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end test suites
- **config/**: Configuration files for development and production environments

## üöÄ Core Components

### Duality Model

- **Mirror Component**: Inward-focused engine for deep user understanding through emotional sensing, need detection, and pattern recognition
- **Bridge Component**: Outward-facing engine for external connections with TruthFilter, content curation, and perspective generation
- **Synthesis Layer**: Dynamic interplay layer managing Mirror‚ÜîBridge flow with state management, ethical checks, and joy optimization

### Supporting Systems

- **Memory System**: Sophisticated architecture with Echoes, Storylines, and Markers for building meaningful continuity and patterns
- **RitualEngine**: Personalized ritual curation and delivery system for structured, meaningful interactions
- **Voice Engine**: Adaptive communication system with distinct tones (Nurturing, Curious)
- **Breath System**: UI/UX pacing mechanism that creates rhythm and presence in interactions
- **Ethics Engine**: Integrated ethical guardrails and consent management throughout the system

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- MongoDB
- Neo4j (for Memory Graph)
- Redis (optional, for caching)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hodge2Franklin/MeX-Docs.git
   cd MeX-Docs
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
