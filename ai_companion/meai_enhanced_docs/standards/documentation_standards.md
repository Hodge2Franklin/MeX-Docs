### Glossary

- Terms and Definitions

## Diagramming Conventions

To ensure clarity and consistency in visual representations, the following diagramming standards are enforced:

### Architectural Views

C4 Model is used for architectural diagrams, with distinct levels:

- **Context**: System boundaries and external interactions
- **Container**: High-level components and their relationships
- **Component**: Detailed internal structure of each component
- **Code (selective)**: Critical algorithm or data flow details

### Diagram Standards

#### Shapes and Colors:

- Rectangles for containers
- Rounded rectangles for components
- Consistent color scheme across diagrams:
  - Synthesis: Green (#e8f5e9 fill, #388e3c border)
  - Mirror: Orange (#fff3e0 fill, #f57c00 border)
  - Bridge: Pink (#fce4ec fill, #c2185b border)
  - Memory System: Blue (#e8eaf6 fill, #3949ab border)
  - User: Light Blue (#e1f5fe fill, #0288d1 border)
- Clear legends explaining symbols and scope

### Process and Pipeline Flows

BPMN 2.0 (Business Process Model and Notation) for representing:

- Data pipeline flows
- Process sequences
- Decision points

### Sequence Diagrams

UML Sequence Diagrams for:

- Component interactions
- MCP context exchanges
- Sequential Thinking flows

## Glossary Approach

The glossary follows these standards:

- **Alphabetical Organization**: Terms organized alphabetically for easy reference
- **Cross-References**: Related terms linked via "See also" references
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Primary terms and sub-terms clearly distinguished
- **Consistent Formatting**:
  - Term: Bold
  - Definition: Plain text
  - Examples: Italics
  - Related terms: Links

## Version Control Strategy

Documentation version control follows these principles:

### Versioning Scheme

- **Major.Minor.Patch** format (e.g., 1.2.3)
- **Major**: Significant architectural changes
- **Minor**: New features or substantial content additions
- **Patch**: Corrections, clarifications, or minor updates

### Change Tracking

- Each document includes a change log at the end
- Change log entries include:
  - Date
  - Version
  - Author
  - Summary of changes
  - Rationale for changes

### Branch Strategy

- **main**: Contains the current stable documentation
- **develop**: Working branch for ongoing documentation updates
- **feature/xxx**: Branches for specific documentation features
- **release/x.y.z**: Branches for preparing specific releases

## Guiding Principles

All MeAi documentation adheres to these core principles:

### Clarity and Precision

- Use clear, unambiguous language
- Define technical terms on first use
- Provide examples for complex concepts
- Use consistent terminology throughout

### Comprehensive Coverage

- Document all aspects of the system
- Include rationale for design decisions
- Address both "what" and "why"
- Cover edge cases and limitations

### First Principles Thinking

- Justify decisions from fundamental principles
- Explain the reasoning behind architectural choices
- Connect implementation details to core mission

### User-Centered Approach

- Consider the documentation user's perspective
- Provide clear navigation paths
- Include practical examples
- Use progressive disclosure for complex topics

### Maintainability

- Modular document structure
- Consistent formatting
- Clear ownership of sections
- Regular review and updates

By following these standards, MeAi documentation maintains the highest level of quality, clarity, and usefulness for all stakeholders.
